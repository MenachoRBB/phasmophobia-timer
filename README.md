# Phasmophobia Timer Overlay

This project is an overlay timer specifically developed for the game *Phasmophobia*. It is designed to be used during gameplay, helping players track critical times visually without having to exit the game.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Timer**: You can easily start or stop the timer using a button or an assigned key.
- **Quick Reset**: Reset the timer to 0 with just one click or key.
- **Visibility Toggle**: Instantly toggle the overlay visibility with customizable keys to keep your screen clean when needed.
- **Minimalist User Interface**: Clean and simple design to avoid interfering with the gaming experience.
  
## Installation

1. Download the executable file from the [releases](https://github.com/username/repo/releases) section.
2. Extract the file to a folder of your choice.
3. Run `PhasmophobiaTimer.exe` and configure the keys according to your preferences.

## Usage

1. Start the program and set the keys to control the timer (Start/Stop, Reset, and Visibility).
2. Open *Phasmophobia* and place the overlay on the part of the screen you prefer. This overlay will always stay on top of the game without interference.
3. Use the configured keys to control the timer during the game without distractions.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed in **C#** using **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**.

### Why C# and WPF?

I chose **C# with WPF** for several reasons:
- **Easy integration with the Windows system**: Since Phasmophobia is a Windows-based game, WPF offers a great way to create modern graphical interfaces that interact natively with the system.
- **Flexible UI design**: WPF provides a XAML-based interface design, making it easier to create customizable and responsive interfaces.
- **High performance**: C# and WPF allow for efficient handling of graphics and overlays while maintaining optimal performance during gameplay.
